Project Name: Robot Body 3D Models

Description:
These 3D models represent the body design for a robot, created using Fusion 360. The models are designed to accommodate breadboards and ESP32 microcontrollers, providing a convenient space for fitting the necessary components to control the robot.

Features:

Detailed Design: The 3D models are intricately designed to ensure a realistic representation of the robot body.
Breadboard Space: Each model includes designated areas for placing breadboards, allowing for easy prototyping and experimentation with electronics.
ESP32 Compatibility: The models are specifically designed to fit ESP32 microcontrollers, providing seamless integration for controlling the robot's functions.
